# Obsidian Daily Nav Plugin

[Install via BRAT](obsidian://brat?plugin=https://github.com/kuboon/daily-nav)

## Features
This plugin adds two commands to the command palette:

- `Daily Nav: Open Yesterday's Note`
- `Daily Nav: Open Tomorrow's Note`

It is recommended to use with [Note Toolbar](https://github.com/chrisgurney/obsidian-note-toolbar)

## How it works
This plugin depends on [obsidian-daily-notes-interface](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-daily-notes-interface) which reads settings from the daily notes plugin and [periodic notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) plugin if you are using.
